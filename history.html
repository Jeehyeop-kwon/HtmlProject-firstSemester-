				<h1 class="history">Company History</h1>
				<p class="history">Nintendo Entertainment System</p><br>
				<p>Introduced in 1985, the NES was an instant hit. Over the course of the next two years, it almost single-handedly revitalized the video game industry. Selling over 60 million units, people brought games like Mario and Zelda into their homes for the first time on the NES.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Game Boy</p><br>
				<p>The screen was four-colors-of-gray but the device defined portable gaming and was enormous fun. Game Boy, which came out in 1989, was closely associated with the classic game Tetris when it debuted. Game Boy is the most successful video game system ever released. Since its introduction in 1989, Game Boy has sold well over 150 million systems worldwide. Originally bundled with the game, Tetris, this little handheld became an instant phenomenon.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</p><br>
				<p>The SNES was released in 1991 and featured 16-bit technology. More processing power meant more entertaining games which helped the SNES sell more than 49 million systems worldwide.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo 64</p><br>
				<p>The N64 set new standards in realistic 3D gaming when it came out in 1996. Super Mario 64 was the system's showcase game and thrilled millions with its amazing graphics and gameplay.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Game Boy Pocket</p><br>
				<p>The same year the N64 came out, the Game Boy Pocket found its way into gamers' school backpacks all over the world. It was smaller than the original Game Boy and came in a variety of colors.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Game Boy Advance</p><br>
				<p>Featuring a larger screen and better graphics than previous versions of the Game Boy, the GBA would go on to sell tens of millions of units worldwide after its North American debut in 2001.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo GameCube</p><br>
				<p>2001 also saw the release of the Nintendo GameCube which one-upped the graphics and gameplay of the N64. It was the first Nintendo system to use optical discs instead of cartridges for its games.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Game Boy Advance SP</p><br>
				<p>Released in 2003, the Game Boy Advance SP had the same size screen as the Game Boy Advance, but the GBA SP was dramatically smaller, lighter, and folded in a clamshell design to become truly pocket portable. It also featured a rechargeable battery and backlit screen.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo DS</p><br>
				<p>Featuring two screens, including a touch screen, a microphone, built-in Wi-Fi capability, and backward compatibility, the DS is an incredibly successful portable gaming device beating its rivals in the marketplace by a wide margin.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo DS Lite</p><br>
				<p>The Nintendo DS is smaller, lighter, and has brighter screens than the previous model and has been embraced by fans. Tens of millions of DS Lites have sold worldwide since its release in early 2006.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Wii</p><br>
				<p>In 2006, Nintendo introduced the Wii and with it several advanced, revolutionary features. Wireless motion-sensitive remote controllers, built-in Wi-Fi capability, and a host of other features have made the Wii the best-selling latest generation console system in the world.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo DSi</p><br>
				<p>In April, Nintendo DSi introduced a revised portable system with two cameras and wireless access to downloadable games via the Nintendo DSi Shop.

Wii Fit Plus brought new options and activities to the fitness software and New Super Mario Bros. Wii brought the hand-held game to the home console. The Nintendo DS family of systems set a new all-time calendar-year U.S. sales record for any console or hand-held system.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo DSi XL</p><br>
				<p>Nintendo DSi XL debuted with screens that were 93 percent larger than those on Nintendo DS Lite. Nintendo and Netflix announced a partnership that would allow most Netflix subscribers to stream movies and TV shows directly through their Wii consoles. The American Heart Association and Nintendo of America formed a multifaceted strategic relationship aimed at helping people create healthy lifestyles through physically active play. The iconic American Heart Association brand appeared on boxes for the Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports Resort software and for the Wii system itself. Super Mario Galaxy 2 was just as well-received and well-reviewed as the original, Metroid: Other M took the franchise in a new direction and Donkey Kong Country Returns revisited a classic franchise. The Wii Games: Summer 2010 competition brought thousands of people of all ages together in fun competitions.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo 3DS</p><br>
				<p>In 2011, Nintendo launched the Nintendo 3DS system in North America, and for the first time ever, users could view and play 3D content without special 3D glasses.

				<p class="history">Wii U</p><br>

Wii U was the first Nintendo system to play new games in HD, while remaining backwards compatible with Wii™ games. This system also introduced support for amiibo™ accessories, figures and cards that gave players in-game bonuses in compatible games.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo 2DS</p><br>
				<p>The Nintendo 2DS™ system joined the Nintendo 3DS™ family in North America in 2013. Its form factor, features, and price made it an excellent option for young gamers. The system played the Nintendo 3DS games only in 2D.</p><br>

				<p class="history">New Nintendo 3DS XL</p><br>
				<p>In 2015, Nintendo released the New Nintendo 3DS XL system in North America. The system offered super-stable face-tracking 3D and screens that were almost twice as large as those of Nintendo 3DS. Built-in amiibo support meant players could more easily tap in amiibo accessories to get bonus in-game content in compatible games.</p><br>

				<p class="history">Nintendo Switch</p><br>
				<p>Released in 2017, the Nintendo Switch™ is a home console that can transition seamlessly to a portable handheld that gamers can enjoy anywhere.
